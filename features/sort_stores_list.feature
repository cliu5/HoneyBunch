Feature: diaplay list of stores sorted by different criteria

    As a college student who needs products
    So that I can quickly browse stores that fit my preferences
    I want to see stores sorted by name or rating

Background: stores have been added to database

    Given the following stores exist:
    | title                   | rating | release_date |
    | Aladdin                 | G      | 25-Nov-1992  |
    | The Terminator          | R      | 26-Oct-1984  |
    | When Harry Met Sally    | R      | 21-Jul-1989  |
    | The Help                | PG-13  | 10-Aug-2011  |
    | Chocolat                | PG-13  | 5-Jan-2001   |
    | Amelie                  | R      | 25-Apr-2001  |
    | 2001: A Space Odyssey   | G      | 6-Apr-1968   |
    | The Incredibles         | PG     | 5-Nov-2004   |
    | Raiders of the Lost Ark | PG     | 12-Jun-1981  |
    | Chicken Run             | G      | 21-Jun-2000  |

    And I am on the RottenPotatoes home page
    Then 10 seed movies should exist
